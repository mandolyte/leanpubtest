# Introduction

This book obviously has very short chapters and sections, since it's a sample.  Your book will be much longer and more interesting!

The way to use this sample book is to read both the PDF file and the .txt files as well as the Book.txt and Sample.txt files.  The PDF file is in the preview and/or the published folder; the .txt files are in the manuscript folder.  (The preview folder only exists if a book preview has been generated on the Preview page; the publish folder only exists if a book has been published on the Publish page.)

So that you can experiment with the Leanpub book format, we have made this sample book content be the default content of a new Leanpub book.  In fact, you may be reading this content in your own book right now.

We make the content appropriate to the book type:

- New Technical books start out with the content in <http://leanpub.com/sampletechnical>
- New Business books start out with the content in <http://leanpub.com/samplebusiness>
- New Fiction books start out with the content in <http://leanpub.com/samplefiction>

The reason that these books are different is that we don't want you to waste your time reading about how to do external code samples if you're writing a business or fiction book.  Also, the page sizes and image sizes are different, etc.

If you're in your own book, the first thing we encourage you to do is to make some small change (like deleting this sentence) and going to the Preview page and previewing a new version of your book.  Once the preview is done, you will have a preview folder in your book's Dropbox folder.  By taking a minute to do this, you'll see how easy it is to edit a Leanpub book.
